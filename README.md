# Python_Projects

This repository houses a collection of projects that cover a range of data analysis and machine learning techniques. Take a look at the projects listed below:

## Project 1: Coasters Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Description:** In this project, I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on coaster data. The EDA involved data exploration, cleaning, univariate analysis, and visualization to uncover insights and correlations within the dataset.  

**Data Source:** The coaster data was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/rollercoaster-database).  

**Techniques Used:** Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were employed for data manipulation and visualization, providing valuable insights into coaster characteristics.  

## Project 2: Film Correlation Analysis
**Description:** This project focuses on analyzing film data. I performed data cleaning, correlation analysis, and data visualization to identify feature correlations within the dataset. This analysis can be useful for understanding factors that influence a film's success.  

**Data Source:** The film data was obtained from [Alex The Analyst repo](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects).  

**Techniques Used:** Python was used for data processing, correlation analysis, and visualizations, allowing for the identification of key factors that impact a film's performance.  

Stay tuned for additional projects in this repository, which will cover a wide range of data science and machine learning topics, including web scraping, sentiment analysis, and more. Each project directory contains detailed documentation, code, and datasets for your exploration. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out.

Happy data analysis and machine learning! üìäüêçüìà
